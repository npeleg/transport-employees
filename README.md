# transport-employees
A project for helping employers find the best commute options for their employees.

Created for the [15 Minutes â€“ Public Transportation Alliance](https://15minutes.co.il/en/15-minutes-public-transportation-alliance/) orgnization.

## Usage
1. Download the  'trans_script.py' file
2. Install the dependencies:

  ```sh
    $ python -m pip install requests
    ...
    $ pip install xlrd
    ...
    $ pip install xlutils
    ...
  ```
 
3. In the parameters section:
  - Change the API key in the parameters section to an API key of your own (if you do not have an API key, follow the instructions [here](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/get-api-key)). You will need to enable the Geocoding and Directions APIs.
  - Change the [country code](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1), [language code](https://developers.google.com/maps/faq#languagesupport) and [time zone](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/88/World_Time_Zones_Map.png) according to your location.
  - You may also determine the names of the input and output files
  
 4. Using the template file "example.xlsx", create an excel spreadsheet which includes the office and employees home addresses
 
 Now you're good to go! run the script:
 
  ```sh
    $ python trans_script.py 
  ```
  
 and see the results by opening the output file.

## To be added in the future:
- Support for cases where office and employee's home are in different countries or time zones
- Statistics and other calculations based on commute results
- GUI and implementation of the script in 15 Minutes' website
